  <h1>Data Cleaner</h1>

  Import CSV files, clean them, and export them as CSV files.

**Note**: The configuration isn't fully developed yet, and so data-cleaner only supports a single CSV format at the moment! This is probably useless for most people in it's current state.

I use this to clean up statement exports from my bank account, before re-importing statements into a MySQL database.
